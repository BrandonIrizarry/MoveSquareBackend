# MoveSquare Backend
This project is a proof-of-concept for writing a backend library for a
rather minimalistic game. The game itself would be written as a
frontend which would declare this library as a dependency.

The goal is to simplify the frontend implementation, as it would only
need to send messages to the backend to update the game state, and
render the current state of the game as exported by the backend.

## Frontend clients using this backend
